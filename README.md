# SecureVault

A robust cross-platform application for secure file encryption and controlled sharing.

## Overview

SecureVault is a security-focused application that provides advanced file protection through encryption. It allows users to create encrypted copies of their files, media, and programs, ensuring data security while maintaining control over access and sharing permissions.

## Key Features

- **File Encryption**: Secure encryption for various file types including documents, media, and programs
- **Automatic Activation Code**: Generates unique activation codes for encrypted files
- **Controlled Sharing**: Users can share encrypted files with specific permissions
- **Permission Management**: Fine-grained control over who can access and further share the encrypted content
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly across different operating systems

## How It Works

1. Users select files they want to protect
2. SecureVault creates an encrypted copy of the selected files
3. An activation code is automatically generated for each encrypted file
4. Users can share the encrypted files along with activation codes
5. Recipients can only access files with valid activation codes
6. Further sharing is restricted based on user-defined permissions
